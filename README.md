# typescript-template

This is a simple template for creating typescript projects. It includes:

- Preconfigured tsconfig
- Prettier + eslint config
- Some sample code
- Conventional commits and commit message linting
  - Also automatic changelogs and version bumping
- `package.json` scripts for running and developing
- A README.md template as well as CODE_OF_CONDUCT
- Renovate bot for updating deps + config (add from <https://github.com/marketplace/renovate>)
- Semantic pull requests: <https://github.com/zeke/semantic-pull-requests>

You can fill out the template README below and remove this notice,
but please retain the notice to this repo as it helps it grow. A star would be awesome too :)
